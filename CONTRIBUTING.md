# Install node.js

Make sure that [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is installed.

Then, run:

```nix
$ npm install
```

# Build the code

```nix
$ ant dist
```

For building and minifying CCC:

```nix
$ ant build-pvc-ccc-release assemble
```

# Test the code

```nix
$ karma
```

# Generate the options documentation

```nix
$ ./generateJsDocs.sh
```

# Generate the API documentation

Install JsDoc 3:

```nix
sudo npm install -g jsdoc@"<=3.3.0"
```

Install the "docstrap" templates:

```nix
npm install ink-docstrap
```

Generate the docs by running:

# Site chart-type pages

The [CCC site](http://ccc.webdetails.org) has one HTML page per chart type, 
each containing several live examples 
and summary documentation of its options and extension points.

The pages are loaded in an _iframe_, from CCC's site main page, through a chart type selector.

Pages are based on a template composed by:
1. Page header: [site/resources/cccExampleHeader.html](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/site/resources/cccExampleHeader.html);
2. Examples section, containing several examples, 
   generated by the 
   XSLT template [site/gen/genTemplates.xsl](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/site/gen/genTemplates.xsl#L64),
   from the examples registered in [site/gen/templates.xml](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/site/gen/templates.xml),
   and whose code is in files placed under [site/resources](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/tree/master/site/resources);
3. Options and Extension points summary sections, 
   generated by the 
   XSLT template [doc/gen/summary/com2html-summary.xsl](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/doc/gen/summary/com2html-summary.xsl), 
   from the information in [CCC's XML docs](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/tree/master/doc/model);
4. Page footer: [site/resources/cccExampleFooter.html](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/site/resources/cccExampleFooter.html).

## Stylizing

For markup related changes to each example's template, 
the [XSLT template](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/site/gen/genTemplates.xsl#L64)
must be modified.
If you don't master XSLT, 
and the changes are small enough, 
you should have no problem: 
just concentrate on the HTML elements, that you'll surely recognize.
Remember that a XSLT file is an XML file, and so XHTML markup must be used
(it's known to not be forgiving of missing closing tags and such).

For CSS and Script related changes, 
first check the 
chart [site/resources/cccExampleHeader.html](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/site/resources/cccExampleHeader.html) file.

You may need to change the CSS and JS files that specifically exist to support the chart type pages.
These files are placed 
under [site/root/ctools/charts/lib](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/tree/master/site/root/ctools/charts/lib).
These are copied to the site's output folder when the site is generated.

Notice that all other content
under [site/root](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/tree/master/site/root)
is only used to help the development of the chart type pages,
and is thus not deployed to the actual site,
where the same, or similar, 
surrounding context is expected to exist.


## Modifying an example

If you want to change the options of an example (the color scale?), 
you should directly modify the specific example's file.
Each example has a corresponding code file, 
placed under [site/resources](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/tree/master/site/resources).
The files are numbered according to their 
registration index in [site/gen/templates.xml](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/site/gen/templates.xml).


## Generating

Make sure you have built the code and generated the JavaScript options' documentation.
Then, run:

```nix
$ ./generateSite.sh
```

Go to `dist/site/ctools/charts/` and check if the generated chart type pages look and behave like you want.


## Deploying

Finally, deploy the changes to the CCC's site, 
using [syncToDemoDotWebdetails.sh](https://github.com/webdetails/ccc/blob/master/syncToDemoDotWebdetails.sh).
Note that you might need to locally modify the script, 
to prepend your user name to the front of the
site's url, as in `user@site.org`, when it differs from your current system user.

Then run:

```nix
$ ./syncToDemoDotWebdetails.sh
```
The deploy script, only synchronizes the contents of the `dist/site/ctools/charts/` directory.
